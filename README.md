# Ratio Bomb Algorithm

This repository contains the specification of potentialy the most destractive zero-day attack ever,
Made for the ethical purpose, of proving atomic weaponery is not the weapon of doom, but an algorithm is.
For if this attack be executed against most of the area of planet earth, there will be a large scale apocalyptic event.

This repository is strictly for ethical reasons, and not for use, for there will be no winners in this battle.

**Specification of the Ratio Bomb Algoritm -**

This zero-day attack, will take down most of the machines and phones in a preditermined radius.

AI which is a machine learning algorithm which studies algorithms, will scan a list of possible attacks,
using resources such as the Exploit-DB. Using machine learning, will identify which attack can be executed by a machine,
and which not.

Will create two stacks.

Stack A will contain a list of attacks which can be executed, and stack B of attacks which cannot be executed.
Stack A will be sorted by qualified programmers, samilliarly to the [Airgeddon](https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon) attacking tool logic, from more probable to succeed to less.

On the first stage of using this tool, there will be an execution of Stack A, a DoS attack of most of the machines in a predetermined radius.
The attack will exploit Wifi and GSM for the initial stages, Using deisgnated antennas. Will take down at least 50 percent of the machines in a radius.
Some of the devices will be completly destroyed, some partially destroyed, and some will not be destroyed at all.

On the second stage of the attack, qualified penetration testers will execute the Stack B attacks which are possible to be executed manually,
and not by a machine.

Both stages can be used in parralel

**Experiments specification -**

First stage of the experiments will be The Micro Stage. Construction of an AI and its execution against machines that are likely to successfully be taken down.

The second stage of the experiments will be The Tirinity Stage. Using hunderds to more than a thousand VMWares execute the attack against those machines,
which consist of the mostly used machines. From the OS percepective. After the end of the execution of the attack, which can be executed again and again,
the machines will switch color from light grey to complete black, indicating full success or partial success, and will send statistics for estimation of the
experiment result, required for the continution of the attack development
