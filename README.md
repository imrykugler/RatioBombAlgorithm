# RatioBombAlgorithm
This repository contains the specification of the potential most distractive zero-day attack,
Made for the ethical purpose, of proving atomic weaponery is not the weapon of doom, but an algorithm is.

This repository is strictly for ethical reasons, and not for use, for there will be no winners in this battle.


Specification of the Ratio Bomb Algoritm -

This zero-day attack, will take down most of the machines and phones in a preditermined ratio.

AI which is a machine learning algorithm which studies algorithms, will scan a list of possible attacks,
using resources such as the Exploit-DB. Use machine learning, will identify which attack can be executed by a machine,
and which not.

Will create to stacks.

Stack A will contain a list of attacks which can be executed, and stack B of attacks which cannot be executed.
Stack A will be sorted by qualified programmers, samilliarly to the Airgeddon attacking tool logic, from more probable to succeed to less.

On the first stage of using this tool, there will be an execution of Stack A, a DoS attack of most of the machines in a predetermined radius.
The attack will exploit Wifi and GSM for the initial stages. Will take down at least 50 percent of the machines in a radius.
Some of the devices will be completly distroyed, some partially distroyed, and some will not be distroyed at all.

On the second stage of the attack, qualified penetration testers will execute the Stack B attacks which are possible to be executed manually,
and not by a machine.

Both stages can be used in parralel
